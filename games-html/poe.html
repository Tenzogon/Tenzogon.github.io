      <h1>Top 3 favorite Path of Exile builds</h1>
      <p>Path of Exile is one of my Favorite games. I have put over 2,800 hours into it and still see my self putting a
        lot more in! Over the years there have been a lot of amazing builds that I have played so I want to list some of
        my favorties.

        <p> Thanks to 3.23 Afflication league, magic find has been extremly affordable for the causal player! This build
          was the first build I got a Mirror of Kalandra! In fact, I've gotten 3 Mirrors with this build!
